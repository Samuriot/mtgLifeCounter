# MTG Life Counter Mobile App

A new Flutter project dedicated towards keeping track of life totals in a game of MTG EDH/Commander Play

# Progress so far:
- Tile Widget created with functional add and subtract life

# To Be Implemented In Order:
1. Style and format the Tile Widget to have easier readability and use
2. Add interactive gestures to respond to longer held taps (i.e., remove 10 life)
3. Add a section to keep track of Commander damage, and from which player this came from
    - Possibly add this as a constantly shuffling pattern (i.e., fade in life total & damages)
    - Or add a mode that can display commander damage
    - Add methods to incremement and decrement commander damage
4. Render a full 4 Player game of Commander
5. Add a Dice Roll Mechanic to see which players go first
6. Keep track of which player has won/record tracking for specific pods of play
